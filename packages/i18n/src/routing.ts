// @repo/i18n — next-intl routing config (Module 06, MONOREPO_CONFIG.md §6).
//
// `locales` is the STATIC superset next-intl's proxy middleware and
// generateStaticParams need at build/request time — next-intl has no
// mechanism to read a dynamic list per request. It is derived from
// `SUPPORTED_LOCALES` below, the registry of every language the site CAN
// route (ADR-178 #1). The DB-driven `Locale` table is the runtime source of
// truth for which of them EXIST (an admin adds a row from this registry) and
// which are ACTIVE (`isActive`) — see locales.ts. A language outside the
// registry still needs a code change and a rebuild: next-intl can't route a
// prefix it doesn't know about.
import { defineRouting } from "next-intl/routing";

/**
 * Every language the site can route (ADR-178 #1). Data about each language
 * that must be known BEFORE any database read: `direction` decides
 * `<html dir>`, and the names prefill the admin's "Add language" form. The
 * admin creates `Locale` rows from this list; it never types a code.
 *
 * Plain ISO 639-1 codes only, each one Google Cloud Translation accepts as a
 * target, because the code is also what the translation queue sends. A code
 * here is a URL prefix, so it must never equal a coded first segment
 * (`routing.test.ts`). The first four are the seeded rows.
