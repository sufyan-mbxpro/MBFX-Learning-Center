// Newsletter contracts (Module 17, ADR-080, changes-21 F7).
//
// Signup is the ONE anonymous public mutation in this repo (ADR-080 #3).
// There is no subject, so `requirePermission()` cannot apply — security.md #1
// assumes one — and its place is taken by a stack that must be present in
// full: the `newsletter` flag, THIS schema, a honeypot field, a per-IP limit
// and a per-email limit. That makes this file load-bearing in a way the other
// contract modules are not: it is the only validation between an unknown
// caller and a write.
//
// No words live here (code-style #2). The admin's filter labels and every
// message a visitor reads come from the catalog.
