# Deploy a live install into a FRESH release directory, then switch to it.
# Runs ON THE SERVER, as the app user, through the live symlink:
#
#   bash ~/htdocs/learn.mbxpro.com/scripts/deploy-release.sh             # deploy origin/main
#   BRANCH=release bash ~/htdocs/learn.mbxpro.com/scripts/deploy-release.sh
#   bash ~/htdocs/learn.mbxpro.com/scripts/deploy-release.sh --rollback  # back to the previous release
#
# Why not scripts/deploy.sh: that one builds inside the directory the running
# server reads from, so for the minutes `next build` takes, the live process
# can be asked for chunks the build has deleted or not written yet. Next
# answers those with its prerendered not-found page and ITS cache headers, and
# Cloudflare pins the 404 (2026-09-23 and 2026-10-02). Here the live
# directory is never written to: the build happens in releases/<stamp>-<sha>,
# and only a finished build is swapped in, by one atomic rename of the
# symlink (docs/ops/deploy.md §11).
#
# Layout (CloudPanel site, as on the live host):
#
#   ~/htdocs/<site>        symlink → ~/releases/<current>   (pm2's cwd goes through it)
#   ~/releases/<stamp>-<sha>/   one checkout + node_modules + .next per deploy
#   ~/shared/.env          the environment, symlinked into every release
#   ~/shared/uploads       UPLOADS_DIR — must be absolute and outside releases
#   ~/shared/repo.git      bare cache of origin, so a release clones locally
#
# Order: fetch → clone → install → generate → migrate deploy → seed → build →
# switch → reload → health check (rolls back on failure) → pm2 save → purge →
# prune. Migrations apply while the OLD release is still serving, so they must
# stay backward compatible with it — the same rule §11 already states. It never
# runs `db:migrate` or `db:reset`.
