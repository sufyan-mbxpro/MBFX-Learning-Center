// The progress island's brain (changes-11 PR 5.3, ADR-056 #1).
//
// **Why a provider rather than one component.** A course page needs the same
// progress in three places that are nowhere near each other in the tree — the
// bar in the header card, the CTA beside it, and the marker on every lesson
// row further down. Three islands would mean three fetches of the same thing
// on one paint. One provider fetches once and the consumers are cheap.
//
// **Why the children stay server-rendered.** `children` is passed THROUGH this
// client component, so everything inside it (the hero, the prose, the
// recommendations) is still rendered on the server and streamed as RSC
// payload. Only the leaves that call `useProgress()` are client components.
//
// **Why there is no optimistic state.** Every write returns the recomputed
// `CourseProgressView` from the server, and that value replaces local state
// wholesale. An optimistic ✓ that a failed request has to walk back is a worse
// experience than a control that is briefly busy, and it would let the
// denormalised counter and the screen disagree.
