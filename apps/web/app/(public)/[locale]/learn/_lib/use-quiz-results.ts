// The quiz index's learner island (design pass 2026-09-09).

// `useLearnerDashboard`'s sibling, and the same shape for the same reason: the
// quiz index is a cached, session-free page (ADR-056 #1), so the only way to
// know how a reader has done is to ask after paint. Everything the cards need
// to RENDER is already in the page payload; this adds three numbers per quiz
// and nothing else.
//
// A hook rather than a provider because there is exactly one consumer tree —
// the shelf — and a context would buy indirection with no second reader. It
// lives beside `quiz-labels.ts` rather than in `progress-provider.tsx`
// because that file is scoped to a COURSE's progress and this asks a question
// about every quiz; merging them would make every lesson page fetch a quiz
// history it never renders.
