// How the homepage OPENS (changes-31).
//
// The hero is the first thing a visitor meets and the first place a
// performance regression shows up. Four properties hold, and none of the four
// is visible in a type or a lint:
//
//   1. The band is STATIC. No query, no feature flag, no published rows — it
//      is composition in the ADR-042 sense, and the homepage carries no
//      dynamic video content at all.
//   2. The footage never reaches the critical path: `preload="metadata"`, no
//      `autoPlay` attribute, and playback started only after hydration and
//      only when motion is wanted. Its POSTER is what paints.
//   3. The band carries no `Reveal`. ADR-104 §6: an element holding the page's
//      largest paint, behind an animation that starts at `opacity: 0`, reports
//      that paint when the animation ends.
//   4. `/learn`'s video rail is untouched. The same component still renders it
//      with `variant="grid"`, which is the surface the published rows were
//      always really for.
//
// Read as source, like `public-chrome.test.ts` beside it: these are async
// server components and apps/web's vitest config carries no JSX transform.
