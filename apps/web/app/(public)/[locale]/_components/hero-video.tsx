"use client";

// The opening slide's background footage (changes-31).
//
// A client island for one reason: whether it plays at all is the visitor's
// decision, and `prefers-reduced-motion` cannot be read on the server. Looping
// footage under a headline is exactly the "large-scale motion" the reduced-
// motion preference is about, and the global `animation-duration: 0.01ms`
// reset in globals.css does nothing to a <video> — it is not an animation.
//
// **There is deliberately no `autoPlay` attribute.** With one, the browser
// starts the footage from the server HTML, before this component has hydrated
// and before anyone has asked whether motion is wanted — a reduced-motion
// visitor would see it play and then stop. Instead the element renders paused
// paused, and playback is started here, after hydration, only when motion is
// allowed.
//
// **There is no `poster` either, since changes-33.** There was one, and it
// was `/hero-app-mockup.jpg` — a picture of the app, not a still from the
// footage. So the slide painted a photograph, held it, and then replaced it
// with something else entirely the moment playback started. A swap between
// two unrelated images reads as a bug, and it is the one the owner reported.
//
// Extracting a real still would have been the other fix and is still the
// better one; nothing in this toolchain can decode the H.264 to do it (the
// only ffmpeg on hand is Playwright's, built webm-only). So the slot is empty
// and the band behind the video carries a solid `--secondary` fill instead:
// the same token the scrim over it fades from, so the hero is a coherent dark
// panel from first paint and the footage arrives INTO it rather than
// replacing something.
//
// With JS off the slide is that panel with its copy on it, which is a
// complete and honest state rather than a broken one. And the 8.8 MB of
// footage is still never on the critical path — `preload="metadata"` and a
// play() that happens after hydration are what guaranteed that, not the
// poster.
//
// Decorative: the footage carries no information the copy beside it does not,
// and it has no audio track to caption. `aria-hidden` keeps it out of the
// accessibility tree entirely, which is why there are no controls either —
// a control a screen reader cannot reach is worse than no control.
